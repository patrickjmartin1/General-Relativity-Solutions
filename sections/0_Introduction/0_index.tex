\chapter*{Introduction}
\label{intro}

This is the introduction. These are solutions to Carroll's General Relativity Textbook. I hope you enjoy. 

A note on terminology. When referencing equations in the subject text, Carroll's Spacetime Geometry \cite{carroll2003spacetime}, we will use the convention (SG ch.eqn), e.g. a reference to equation 15 of chapter 3 will expressed as (SG 3.15). This is in contrast to using the typical citation, as we will reference the subject text extensively and I think this will be more clear for the reader.
