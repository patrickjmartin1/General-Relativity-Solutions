\chapter{Coordinate Transforms and Metric Normalization}
\label{appendix_coord_trans}

This is a placeholder appendix, in case we ever get around to writing down the scratch work I did in problem 2.9.a regarding coordinate transformations, metric normalization, and working with Jacobians. 

The work ultimately did not have much impact on my answer to 2.9.a, but it might be useful in general, especially as a reference.
