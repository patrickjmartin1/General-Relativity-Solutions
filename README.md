Solutions to Carroll's Introduction to General Relativity Spacetime and Geometry

Welcome to my solutions manual! You will find the most up-to-date version of the document in main.pdf, under the main branch. My goal is to provide a complete answer to every problem in the textbook, but this will be a long work in progress. For the time being, I will do my best to update the status here. Enjoy! 

If you have any questions or comments, especially in relation to the correctness of any problem or equation, please do not hesitate to reach out. 

Update 6/14/22: Published the solution to problem 2.9, along with the initial commit of many of the files to the main branch.
